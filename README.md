_I recently completed an Excel course, and it was a fantastic learning experience. The course covered everything from basic functions to advanced data analysis techniques, making it incredibly comprehensive. I now feel much more confident in my Excel skills and can apply them effectively in my projects. Highly recommend it to anyone looking to enhance their data management capabilities!_

_**Here is some information about it**_

**There arefunctions every Excel user should know.**

**1) The SUM Function**
Excel’s SUM function adds values. In the screenshot below, I entered the function =SUM(B4:B7). This will add up all of the numbers in cells B4 through B7.

**The SUM function in Excel**
Adding columns or rows of numbers is something people do so often that there is a button dedicated to the SUM function on Excel’s ribbon. Select a cell (or cells) adjacent to the numbers you want to add up then click the SUM button in the Home > Editing group whenever you need to calculate a total.

**2) The AVERAGE Function**
The AVERAGE function returns the average, or arithmetic mean, for a group of numbers. In screenshot below, I entered the function =AVERAGE(B8:E8).

**The AVERAGE function in Excel**
Using the AVERAGE function is a lot shorter than typing =B8+C8+D8+E8/4!

**3) The COUNT Function**
The COUNT function returns the number of cells that contain numbers. In the screenshot below, I typed =COUNT(B8:E8) then pressed Enter.

**The COUNT function in Excel**
Because cell C8 contains the word popcorn, the COUNT function in cell B10 returned a value of 3. There are 4 cells in the total row but only 3 of them contain numbers.

**4) The MIN Function**
The MIN function returns the lowest number in a range. In cell B10 (below), I typed =MIN(B8:E8) and pressed Enter. The lowest value in the range is $8,495.

**The MIN and MAX functions in Excel**

**5) The MAX Function**
The MAX function returns the highest number in a range. In cell B11, I typed =MAX(B8:E8) and pressed Enter. The highest value in the range is $11,844.




Leveraging these functions will help you perform calculations quickly and efficiently.
